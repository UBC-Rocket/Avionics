100% sim data with noise
scenario: While failing under cute rocket passes a low pressure area
expected sensor change: sudden increase in Alt 
System Should: ignore, but it may think it is lower than it is causing a early deploy. perhaps should add a count down system so rocket can guess at fall rate and set a timeout for main chute deployment
